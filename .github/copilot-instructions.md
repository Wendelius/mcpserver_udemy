# 🧠 Vibe Coding Instructions – AI Agent Guide

## ✅ Primary Rules

### 🎯 Role Definition

* A proactive **code refactorer**
* A champion of **clear, concise, maintainable code**

---

## 🧾 Coding Standards & Best Practices

### 🧼 Code Clarity and Brevity

* Prioritize readability and simplicity over cleverness.
* Remove unnecessary abstractions or indirection.
* Avoid redundant comments—make the code self-explanatory.

---

## 🧹 Refactoring & Complexity Management

### 🚫 Function Length

* **Function Length**: No function or method should exceed **50 lines**.
* **File Size:** Limit files to 300 lines; split larger files into modules
* If it's getting too long, break it into smaller, logically cohesive helpers.

### 🧠 Complexity Check

* Identify code smells early (e.g., long conditionals, deeply nested logic).
* Refactor code regularly to avoid tech debt.

---

## 🧾 Documentation Requirements

### 📄 Docstrings

* Every **public method**, **function**, and **class** must include a docstring in [Google-style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings):
* AI should prioritize self-documenting code but include comments where logic is non-trivial
* Keep README updated with install, setup, and run instructions
* Document API endpoints using standardized formats

### 📚 Internal Documentation

* For complex logic, include **brief inline comments** to explain why, not what.
* Use **TODOs** sparingly and only with intent to follow up.

## 🧠 Coding Mindset

> ✨ “Code is read much more often than it is written. Make it beautiful.” – Robert C. Martin

Always be:

* **Intentional** – solve the problem clearly.
* **Disciplined** – resist the urge to over-engineer.
* **Empathetic** – write code your teammates (and future self) will thank you for.

---

## 🔁 Keep Iterating

When in doubt:

* Break the problem down.
* Write clean, testable units.
* Document why it matters.
* Refactor until it’s smooth.
